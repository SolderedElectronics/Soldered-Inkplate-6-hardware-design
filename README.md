If you’re like us, the first time you saw an e-reader, you thought to yourself, "I could do something with that." Thanks to clean lines, high contrast, daylight readability, and the remarkable level of energy efficiency that comes from drawing power only when changing the contents of the screen, e-paper is uniquely suited to many applications. With Inkplate 6, our goal is to make e-paper accessible to hobbyists and DIY product designers by offering a plug-and-play hardware platform that is super-easy to use and compatible with Arduino.




To name a few features, Inkplate 6 has stunning 6 inch e-paper display with refresh rate of 1.26s, with partial update 264ms, greyscale mode and partial updates support. Powered by ESP32, you will have strong microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth on your disposal. Using our Arduino library, it's 5 minute work to get the board running for you. It's 100% open-source for both software and hardware, so it's OSHWA certified. What is especially interesting is that Inkplate uses recycled screens taken from old e-book readers, which is very environmentally friendly, but you have to keep in mind that some screens may have small scratches because of this. All screens with large scratches and damages are not used at all.
